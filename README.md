# pic some 🖼

The react application for viewing and ordering different pics was the final project for React advanced course at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview) by [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll). I have added local storage to make the pics user liked or add to the cart persist and I have used react-router version 6 and some little modifications to have more challenges. I have dockerized this app using docker-compose.
